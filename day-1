1) The time complexity for the following code will be O(N+M) because the first loop is O(N) and the second loop is O(M). The space complexity will be O(1) as there is no additional space utilized.
2)It would be B(X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs) as in asymptotic analysis we consider growth of algorithm in terms of input size.
